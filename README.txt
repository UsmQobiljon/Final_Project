Final project is about movement detector with photo camera. 
Camera stays in deep sleep mode. 
Whenever PIR motion sensor detects movement red LED light is turned on and after that it sends signal to transistor. 
After this transistor wakes up the camera. 
Camera turns on, flashlight lights then camera takes a picture. 
After that it saves the picture in microSD. 
In order to see the taken picture you have to connect microSD to computer.  
If PIR motion sensor does not detect any movement it stays idle for 5 seconds. 
After 5 seconds camera goes back to deep sleep mode. If movement detected the process repeats.
